#Data-Analysis-project

you will formulate your own research question OR hypothesis and investigate it and write a report of your findings in your Solution document.  The research question OR hypothesis should be related to investigating the relationships between a selected independent variable and a selected dependent variable. You can also investigate about the differences between two or more groups with respect to a variable.
Your investigation must include the use of a proper measure of correlation/other suitable measures to show the relationships/ differences between your selected variables and appropriate visualizations. Visualizations can be provided either by utilizing folium or matplotlib
 	Analysis and Findings

You must choose an appropriate statistical method for the types of measure in the variables in your study 
•	Give your critical interpretation and conclusions about those observed correlations. 
•	Produce tabular summaries of the data in the form of crosstabs or pivot tables,along with your critical interpretation of those tables
•	At least two relevant visualizations ,along with your critical interpretations of each visualization
